# telegram-quiz
A bot that uses `pyautogui` to fetch quiz from eba.gov.tr and some other text resources and push to telegram as quiz. Initially we built this to get prize from [telegram quiz contest](https://telegram.org/blog/400-million). After time for submission has ended, they changed to rules so that quizes must be created from submitter. So we failed to get any price
